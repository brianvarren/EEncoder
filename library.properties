sentence=Lightweight rotary encoder library optimized for RP2040-based synthesizers.
paragraph=EEncoder provides a clean callback-based interface for rotary encoders with push buttons, featuring built-in debouncing, long-press detection, and intelligent acceleration. Designed specifically for digital synthesizer interfaces on RP2040 boards with minimal memory footprint (~28 bytes per encoder). Single count per detent for precise UI control. Inspired by EncoderButton's elegant API design but built from scratch without dependencies. Perfect for Raspberry Pi Pico and other RP2040-based music projects.
